This application creates a MySQL database named "QuantigrationUpdatesâ€Ž" with three tables to read data from three .csv files.
After reading each file, it populates the tables and analyses according to selected queries to gain insights.
This app's purpose is to analyze the reason for the returned RMAs and provide a detailed report to management on what products from what state are being returned the most and what the primary reasons are for it.
The returned analyzed queries were outputted graphically and summarized in a report that could be read and understood by a non technical user.
The app cross-matched information from 38K orders from 48 US states and divided them into four categories.
The app recognizes a clear pattern of two companies' products that mainly returned from two main states in the US and provides possible solutions for management to solve this issue.
